# large-csv-import-using-ajax

Every developer in our development period faces a requirement of upload CSV file into a database. So for that, I try various ways like using PHP file submit. But there is a problem with server or website become stop no one can be used. Due to heavy load. So try to jquery to insert the recording step by step. so that resource will be free each time. the concurrent user can use a resource.

I have face problem with WordPress in post insert,  So I create the code for the WordPress insert post it has a great speed.
